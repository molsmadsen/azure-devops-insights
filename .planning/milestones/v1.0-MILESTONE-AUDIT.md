# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1.0 — Azure DevOps Insights, Phases 1–2
**Audited:** 2026-02-25T14:00:00Z
**Status:** ⚡ tech_debt — all requirements functionally satisfied; no critical blockers; documentation and frontmatter gaps need resolution before release

---

## Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Requirements | 10/10 | All 10 milestone requirements functionally implemented |
| Phases | 2/2 | Both phases verified |
| Integration | 10/10 | All cross-phase wiring solid; 3 documentation gaps found |
| E2E Flows | 3/3 | install → setup → pr-metrics flows complete end-to-end |

---

## Phase Verification Status

| Phase | Status | Score | Critical Gaps |
|-------|--------|-------|---------------|
| 01-foundation | gaps_found | 9/11 | 2 gaps in REQUIREMENTS.md text (doc mismatches, non-blocking) |
| 02-pr-metrics | human_needed | 11/11 | 0 — all automated checks pass; human-verified in 02-02-SUMMARY |

**Phase 01 gap summary:** Both gaps are documentation mismatches in REQUIREMENTS.md, not implementation failures. The codebase is functionally correct. The Phase 1 verifier explicitly stated: *"Neither gap blocks Phase 2. The implementation is sound; only requirement text needs reconciliation."*

**Phase 02 gap summary:** No gaps. `human_needed` status means all automated checks passed; the live narrative confirmation was documented in `02-02-SUMMARY.md` and confirmed by human checkpoint in `02-02-PLAN.md`.

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Milestone Requirements: Phase 1

| REQ-ID | Description | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| DIST-01 | Install via two-step marketplace flow | PARTIAL (doc mismatch) | ✓ listed (01-04) | `[x]` | **partial** — implementation correct; REQUIREMENTS.md text stale; help/README not updated post-Phase 2 |
| AUTH-01 | /adi:setup configures org/project/PAT | FAILED (doc mismatch) | ✓ listed (01-04) | `[x]` | **partial** — setup fully functional; REQUIREMENTS.md says "OS keychain" but plaintext 0o600 was intentional design |
| AUTH-02 | PAT validation with scope reporting | VERIFIED | ✓ listed (01-04) | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| AUTH-03 | Re-run /adi:setup without data loss | VERIFIED | ✓ listed (01-04) | `[x]` | **satisfied** |

### Milestone Requirements: Phase 2

| REQ-ID | Description | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| PR-01 | Avg time from PR open to first review | SATISFIED | ✗ missing (02-01 no field) | `[x]` | **partial** — implemented with full evidence in VERIFICATION; frontmatter gap in 02-01-SUMMARY |
| PR-02 | Avg cycle time (open to merge) | SATISFIED | ✗ missing (02-01 no field) | `[x]` | **partial** — implemented with full evidence in VERIFICATION; frontmatter gap in 02-01-SUMMARY |
| PR-03 | Reviewer distribution | SATISFIED | ✗ missing (02-01 no field) | `[x]` | **partial** — implemented with full evidence in VERIFICATION; frontmatter gap in 02-01-SUMMARY |
| PR-04 | Stale PR flagging | SATISFIED | ✗ missing (02-01 no field) | `[x]` | **partial** — implemented with full evidence in VERIFICATION; frontmatter gap in 02-01-SUMMARY |
| PR-05 | Bottleneck reviewer detection | SATISFIED | ✗ missing (02-01 no field) | `[x]` | **partial** — implemented with full evidence in VERIFICATION; frontmatter gap in 02-01-SUMMARY |
| PR-06 | AI narrative output (not raw numbers) | SATISFIED | ✓ listed (02-02) | `[x]` | **satisfied** |

**Unsatisfied requirements:** 0
**Orphaned requirements:** 0 (all 10 appear in at least one phase VERIFICATION.md)
**Partial requirements:** 7 (all partial status is doc/frontmatter issues; implementations are functional)

**FAIL gate check:** No `unsatisfied` requirements → FAIL gate does NOT trigger. Status is `tech_debt`.

## Integration Findings

### Cross-Phase Wiring

All wiring is solid. 12 exports properly imported and used. E2E integration confirmed clean.

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| pr-metrics.mjs → ado-client.mjs imports | ✓ WIRED | All 4 Phase 2 fetch functions imported and called (lines 6-7 pr-metrics.mjs) |
| pr-metrics.mjs → config.mjs imports | ✓ WIRED | loadConfig + configExists imported and used |
| Config contract (setup writes → pr-metrics reads) | ✓ SOLID | orgUrl/project/pat keys match exactly between saveConfig and ado-client consumption |
| PLUGIN_ROOT resolver consistency | ✓ CONSISTENT | Identical resolver one-liner in setup/SKILL.md and pr-metrics/SKILL.md |
| Config-missing error handling | ✓ GRACEFUL | Two-level guard: SKILL.md --check-config + main() catch in pr-metrics.mjs |

### Integration Gaps (Documentation Only — Not Wiring Failures)

**Gap 1 (High): `/adi:pr-metrics` missing from help skill** — `skills/help/SKILL.md` still lists `/adi:pr-metrics` under "Coming in future versions." Users running `/adi:help` after installation will not discover the Phase 2 skill. Affects: DIST-01, PR-06.

**Gap 2 (Medium): README Skills Reference outdated** — README.md main skills table only lists `/adi:setup` and `/adi:help`. `/adi:pr-metrics` appears only in the "Coming Soon (Phase 2+)" section. Affects: DIST-01.

**Gap 3 (Low): README local dev path wrong** — `claude --plugin-dir ./azure-devops-insights` should be `claude --plugin-dir .`. Pre-existing, flagged in Phase 1 verification. Affects: DIST-01.

### E2E Flows

| Flow | Status | Steps |
|------|--------|-------|
| Install | ✓ COMPLETE | `/plugin marketplace add` → `/plugin install adi@...` → skills discoverable |
| Setup | ✓ COMPLETE | `/adi:setup` → prompts → validateConnection → saveConfig → `~/.adi/config.json` |
| PR Metrics | ✓ COMPLETE | `/adi:pr-metrics` → --check-config guard → fetch → compute → AI narration |

## Tech Debt Summary

### Phase 01-foundation (4 items)

- `REQUIREMENTS.md` DIST-01: text describes non-existent `claude plugin add github:org/repo` — implementation correctly uses two-step marketplace flow; requirement text is stale
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` AUTH-01: text says "OS credential store / keychain" — implementation uses `~/.adi/config.json` with `0o600` (intentional design from research); requirement text overstates security posture
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` AUTH-01/AUTH-03: use `/ado:setup` prefix — all code/docs correctly use `/adi:setup`
- `README.md` line 79: local dev command path `./azure-devops-insights` → should be `.`

### Phase 02-pr-metrics (4 items)

- `02-01-SUMMARY.md`: missing `requirements-completed` frontmatter — PR-01 through PR-05 are verified and implemented but not listed; add to frontmatter for 3-source traceability
- `scripts/ado-client.mjs`: `adoGet` export is orphaned — Phase 2 uses explicit-config functions; Phase 3 must not use `adoGet` (different calling convention; implicit `loadConfig()`)
- `skills/help/SKILL.md`: `/adi:pr-metrics` still under "Coming in future versions" — must move to available command table **(user-visible impact)**
- `README.md`: Skills Reference table missing `/adi:pr-metrics` row; "Coming Soon" section still lists it **(user-visible impact)**

**Total: 8 items across 2 phases**

---

## Orphaned Requirements

None detected. All 10 milestone requirements (DIST-01, AUTH-01, AUTH-02, AUTH-03, PR-01 through PR-06) appear in at least one phase VERIFICATION.md with evidence.
