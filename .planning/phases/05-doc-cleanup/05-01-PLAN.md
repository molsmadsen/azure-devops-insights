<objective>
Close 4 user-visible documentation gaps and 1 planning artifact gap identified by the v1.0 milestone audit. All underlying functionality is fully shipped — this plan makes the documentation match the implementation.

Purpose: Before v1.0 is archived, users discovering the plugin must find /adi:pr-metrics listed as available (not "coming soon"), README must accurately reflect shipped skills, and 02-01-SUMMARY.md must carry the requirements-completed field so PR-01 through PR-05 have full 3-source traceability.

Output: Updated skills/help/SKILL.md, README.md, and .planning/phases/02-pr-metrics/02-01-SUMMARY.md. REQUIREMENTS.md is read and verified — edit only if stale text is still present (research indicates it was already corrected on 2026-02-25).

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Fix user-visible docs — promote /adi:pr-metrics in help skill and README</name>
  <files>skills/help/SKILL.md, README.md</files>
  <action>
**CRITICAL: Read each file before writing. Only apply a change if the current text matches the stale state described below.**

### skills/help/SKILL.md

Read the file. Locate the commands table and the "Coming in future versions" list.

If the table does NOT yet contain a `/adi:pr-metrics` row, add it after the `/adi:help` row:
```
| `/adi:pr-metrics` | AI-narrated pull request health report (review times, stale PRs, bottlenecks). |
```

If the "Coming in future versions" list still contains `- /adi:pr-metrics — AI-narrated pull request health report`, remove that line.

If the "Getting started" step 2 still reads `Run /adi:pr-metrics to see your first report (available in Phase 2)`, change it to `Run /adi:pr-metrics to see your first pull request health report`.

The final file must match this exact structure (full file shown in 05-RESEARCH.md "Correct skills/help/SKILL.md Final State" section):
- Table has 3 rows: /adi:setup, /adi:help, /adi:pr-metrics
- "Coming in future versions" list has 5 items (no /adi:pr-metrics)
- Step 2 has no "(available in Phase 2)" phrasing

After writing, verify: `grep -n "pr-metrics" skills/help/SKILL.md`
Expected: exactly 2 lines — one in the table row, one in step 2. None in the future versions list.

### README.md

Read the file. Apply the following 3 changes only where the stale text is still present:

**Change A — Skills Reference table:** If `/adi:pr-metrics` is NOT in the main skills table, add this row after the `/adi:help` row:
```
| `/adi:pr-metrics` | AI-narrated pull request health report — review times, stale PRs, bottlenecks. |
```

**Change B — Coming Soon section:** If the section heading still reads `### Coming Soon (Phase 2+)` or the table still contains a `/adi:pr-metrics` row, apply both:
1. Rename heading to `### Coming Soon (Phase 3+)`
2. Remove the `/adi:pr-metrics` row from the Coming Soon table

**Change C — Local dev path:** If line ~79 reads `claude --plugin-dir ./azure-devops-insights`, change it to `claude --plugin-dir .`

After writing, verify:
```
grep -n "pr-metrics" README.md
grep -n "Phase 2+" README.md
grep -n "plugin-dir" README.md
```
Expected: pr-metrics appears only in the Skills Reference table (not in Coming Soon); "Phase 2+" has 0 matches; plugin-dir line shows `.` not `./azure-devops-insights`.

    - skills/help/SKILL.md commands table has /adi:pr-metrics row; "Coming in future versions" list does not mention it
    - README.md Skills Reference table has /adi:pr-metrics row
    - README.md "Coming Soon" section heading reads "Phase 3+"; /adi:pr-metrics not listed there
    - README.md local dev command reads `claude --plugin-dir .`

  <name>Task 2: Fix planning artifacts — add requirements-completed to 02-01-SUMMARY.md and verify REQUIREMENTS.md</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/02-pr-metrics/02-01-SUMMARY.md, .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md</files>
  <action>
**CRITICAL: Read each file before writing.**

### .planning/phases/02-pr-metrics/02-01-SUMMARY.md

Read the file. Check if the YAML frontmatter block (between the opening `---` and closing `---`) contains a `requirements-completed` field.

If the field is ABSENT, insert the following line immediately after the `tags` line (line 5):
```yaml
requirements-completed: [PR-01, PR-02, PR-03, PR-04, PR-05]
```

Use inline list format (matching the `tags` field format) — not multi-line YAML list format.
Do not change any other frontmatter fields or body content.

After writing, verify: `grep -n "requirements-completed" .planning/phases/02-pr-metrics/02-01-SUMMARY.md`
Expected: 1 match showing the inline list with PR-01 through PR-05.

### .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md

Read the file. Check these 4 items and only edit if the stale text is still present:

1. **DIST-01 line**: If it still references `claude plugin add github:org/repo` single-command install, replace with the two-step marketplace flow description. If it already reads "two-step marketplace flow", no edit needed.

2. **AUTH-01 line**: If it still says "stored securely (OS credential store / keychain)", replace with "stored at `~/.adi/config.json` with 0o600 permissions". If it already shows the correct path, no edit needed.

3. **AUTH-01/AUTH-03 prefix**: If either still uses `/ado:setup`, change to `/adi:setup`. If both already use `/adi:setup`, no edit needed.

4. **Traceability table**: Verify DIST-01 and PR-06 rows show Phase 5 gap closure. If they do not, update them to match:
   - DIST-01 row: `Phase 1 + Phase 5 (gap closure)` | `Complete (doc gap -> Phase 5)`
   - PR-06 row: `Phase 2 + Phase 5 (gap closure)` | `Complete (doc gap -> Phase 5)`

After reading, if NO changes are needed (all text already correct), do not write the file. Note in the task output: "REQUIREMENTS.md — all text already correct, no changes applied."

After writing (if changes made), verify: `grep -n "ado:setup\|keychain\|github:org" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`
Expected: 0 matches (all stale references removed).
  </action>
  <verify>
    <automated>grep -n "requirements-completed" C:/Source/project-overview/.planning/phases/02-pr-metrics/02-01-SUMMARY.md && grep -c "ado:setup\|keychain\|github:org" C:/Source/project-overview/.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md || true</automated>
    <manual>02-01-SUMMARY.md frontmatter has requirements-completed field with PR-01 through PR-05. REQUIREMENTS.md has no stale /ado:setup, keychain, or github:org references.</manual>
  </verify>
  <done>
    - 02-01-SUMMARY.md frontmatter contains `requirements-completed: [PR-01, PR-02, PR-03, PR-04, PR-05]`
    - REQUIREMENTS.md contains no stale /ado:setup prefix, keychain text, or github:org/repo install reference (either already correct before task or corrected by task)
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

After both tasks complete, run these checks:

```bash
# 1. /adi:pr-metrics in help skill table (not in future versions)
grep -n "pr-metrics" skills/help/SKILL.md

# 2. /adi:pr-metrics in README skills table; no Phase 2+ Coming Soon heading
grep -n "pr-metrics" README.md
grep -c "Phase 2+" README.md

# 3. Local dev path corrected
grep -n "plugin-dir" README.md

# 4. 02-01-SUMMARY.md has requirements-completed
grep -n "requirements-completed" .planning/phases/02-pr-metrics/02-01-SUMMARY.md

# 5. No stale references in REQUIREMENTS.md
grep -c "ado:setup\|keychain\|github:org" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md || true
```

All checks pass when:
- `skills/help/SKILL.md`: pr-metrics appears in table row and step 2; NOT in future versions list
- `README.md`: pr-metrics in Skills Reference table; "Phase 2+" count is 0; plugin-dir line shows `.`
- `02-01-SUMMARY.md`: requirements-completed field present with inline list
- `REQUIREMENTS.md`: stale reference count is 0
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. `/adi:help` command output would list `/adi:pr-metrics` as an available command (not "coming soon")
2. README.md Skills Reference table includes `/adi:pr-metrics`; Coming Soon section removed it and updated heading to Phase 3+
3. README.md local dev command is `claude --plugin-dir .`
4. `02-01-SUMMARY.md` frontmatter has `requirements-completed: [PR-01, PR-02, PR-03, PR-04, PR-05]`
5. REQUIREMENTS.md contains no stale /ado:setup, keychain, or github:org/repo text
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-doc-cleanup/05-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
